# Movie Dataset Analysis - Final project for COMP 3380 (Databases)
This database contains movies and information about them (length, revenue, budget, etc.), cast/crew and information about them (birthdate, deathdate, gender, birthplace, etc.), the languages spoken in each movie, keywords defining each movie, collections/genres that movies can be a part of, and the production companies involved in creation.
